# Neshan Android Application Guidelines 


## 1. Java guidelines

### 1.1 Class files
Class names are written in [UpperCamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).

For classes that extend an Android component, the name of the class should end with the name of the component; for example: `SignInActivity`, `SignInFragment`, `ImageUploaderService`, `ChangePasswordDialog`.

### 1.2 Don't ignore exceptions

You must never do the following:

```java
void setServerPort(String value) {

    try {
    
        serverPort = Integer.parseInt(value);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) { }
}
```

_While you may think that your code will never encounter this error condition or that it is not important to handle it, ignoring exceptions like above creates mines in your code for someone else to trip over some day. You must handle every Exception in your code in some principled way. The specific handling varies depending on the case._ - ([Android code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html))

See alternatives [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#dont-ignore-exceptions).

### 1.4 Fully qualify imports

This is bad: `import foo.*;`

This is good: `import foo.Bar;`

See more info [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#fully-qualify-imports)

### 1.5 Fields definition and naming

Fields should be defined at the __top of the file__ and they should follow the naming rules listed below.

* Private, non-static field names start with __m__.
* Private, static field names start with __s__.
* Other fields start with a lower case letter.
* Static final fields (constants) are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
* Enums variables should be all upper case ```private enum Suit { CLUBS, HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS }```


Example:

```java
public class MyClass {

    public static final int SOME_CONSTANT = 42;
    public int publicField;
    private static MyClass sSingleton;
    int mPackagePrivate;
    private int mPrivate;
    protected int mProtected;
}
```

### 1.6 Treat acronyms as words

| Good           | Bad            |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| `XmlHttpRequest` | `XMLHTTPRequest` |
| `getCustomerId`  | `getCustomerID`  |
| `String url`     | `String URL`     |
| `long id`        | `long ID`        |


### 1.7 Use standard brace style

Braces go on the same line as the code before them.

```java
class MyClass {

    int func() {
    
        if (something) {
	
            // ...
        } else if (somethingElse) {
	
            // ...
        } else {
	
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

Braces around the statements are required even when the condition and the body fit on one line.

If the condition and the body fit on one line and that line is shorter than the max line length, then braces are not required, e.g.


```java
if (condition) {

    body();
    } 
```

This is __bad__:

```java
if (condition) body();  // bad!

```

### 1.8 Indenting

* There should be a new line after every new block.
* There should be new lines after and before ```return``` statment.

a Method example :

```java
    public int myMethod() {
        // newLine
        int a;
        int b;
        a = 1;
        b = 2;
        int c = a + b;
        // newLine
        return c;
        // newLine
    }
```

### 1.9 Annotations

#### 1.9.1 Annotations practices

According to the Android code style guide, the standard practices for some of the predefined annotations in Java are:

* `@Override`: The @Override annotation __must be used__ whenever a method overrides the declaration or implementation from a super-class. For example, if you use the @inheritdocs Javadoc tag, and derive from a class (not an interface), you must also annotate that the method @Overrides the parent class's method.

* `@SuppressWarnings`: The @SuppressWarnings annotation should only be used under circumstances where it is impossible to eliminate a warning. If a warning passes this "impossible to eliminate" test, the @SuppressWarnings annotation must be used, so as to ensure that all warnings reflect actual problems in the code.

More information about annotation guidelines can be found [here](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#use-standard-java-annotations).

#### 1.9.2 Annotations style

__Classes, Methods and Constructors__

When annotations are applied to a class, method, or constructor, they are listed after the documentation block and should appear as __one annotation per line__ .

```java
/* This is the documentation block about the class */
@AnnotationA
@AnnotationB
public class MyAnnotatedClass { }
```

__Fields__

Annotations applying to fields should be listed __on the same line__, unless the line reaches the maximum line length.

```java
@Nullable @Mock DataManager mDataManager;
```

### 1.13 Class member ordering

There is no single correct solution for this but using a __logical__ and __consistent__ order will improve code learnability and readability. It is recommendable to use the following order:

1. Constants
2. Fields
  2.1. View Fields
  2.2. Other Fields
3. Constructors
4. Override methods and callbacks (public or private)
  4.1. Android life cycle methods
  4.2. Other
5. Public methods
6. Private methods
7. Inner classes or interfaces

Example:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    private static final String TAG = MainActivity.class.getSimpleName();

    private String mTitle;
    private TextView mTextViewTitle;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        ...
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
    	mTitle = title;
    }

    private void setUpView() {
        ...
    }

    static class AnInnerClass {

    }

}
```

If your class is extending an __Android component__ such as an Activity or a Fragment, it is a good practice to order the override methods so that they __match the component's lifecycle__. For example, if you have an Activity that implements `onCreate()`, `onDestroy()`, `onPause()` and `onResume()`, then the correct order is:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

	//Order matches Activity lifecycle
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {}

    @Override
    public void onResume() {}

    @Override
    public void onPause() {}

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {}

}
```

### 1.14 Parameter ordering in methods

When programming for Android, it is quite common to define methods that take a `Context`. If you are writing a method like this, then the __Context__ must be the __first__ parameter.

The opposite case are __callback__ interfaces that should always be the __last__ parameter.

Examples:

```java
// Context always goes first
public User loadUser(Context context, int userId);

// Callbacks always go last
public void loadUserAsync(Context context, int userId, UserCallback callback);
```

### 1.15 Parameter ordering in methods

When programming for Android, it is quite common to define methods that take a `Context`. If you are writing a method like this, then the __Context__ must be the __first__ parameter.

The opposite case are __callback__ interfaces that should always be the __last__ parameter.

Examples:

```java
// Context always goes first
public User loadUser(Context context, int userId);

// Callbacks always go last
public void loadUserAsync(Context context, int userId, UserCallback callback);
```

### 1.16 String constants, naming, and values

Many elements of the Android SDK such as `SharedPreferences`, `Bundle`, or `Intent` use a key-value pair approach so it's very likely that even for a small app you end up having to write a lot of String constants.

When using one of these components, you __must__ define the keys as a `static final` fields and they should be prefixed as indicated below.

| Element            | Field Name Prefix |
| -----------------  | ----------------- |
| SharedPreferences  | `PREF_`             |
| Bundle             | `BUNDLE_`           |
| Fragment Arguments | `ARGUMENT_`         |
| Intent Extra       | `EXTRA_`            |
| Intent Action      | `ACTION_`           |

Note that the arguments of a Fragment - `Fragment.getArguments()` - are also a Bundle. However, because this is a quite common use of Bundles, we define a different prefix for them.

Example:

```java
// Note the value of the field is the same as the name to avoid duplication issues
static final String PREF_EMAIL = "PREF_EMAIL";
static final String BUNDLE_AGE = "BUNDLE_AGE";
static final String ARGUMENT_USER_ID = "ARGUMENT_USER_ID";

// Intent-related items use full package name as value
static final String EXTRA_SURNAME = "com.myapp.extras.EXTRA_SURNAME";
static final String ACTION_OPEN_USER = "com.myapp.action.ACTION_OPEN_USER";
```

### 1.18 Line length limit

Code lines should not exceed __100 characters__. If the line is longer than this limit there are usually two options to reduce its length:

* Extract a local variable or method (preferable).
* Apply line-wrapping to divide a single line into multiple ones.

There are two __exceptions__ where it is possible to have lines longer than 100:

* Lines that are not possible to split, e.g. long URLs in comments.
* `package` and `import` statements.

#### 2.2.15.1 Line-wrapping strategies

There isn't an exact formula that explains how to line-wrap and quite often different solutions are valid. However there are a few rules that can be applied to common cases.

__Break at operators__

When the line is broken at an operator, the break comes __before__ the operator. For example:

```java
int longName = anotherVeryLongVariable + anEvenLongerOne - thisRidiculousLongOne
        + theFinalOne;
```

__Assignment Operator Exception__

An exception to the `break at operators` rule is the assignment operator `=`, where the line break should happen __after__ the operator.

```java
int longName =
        anotherVeryLongVariable + anEvenLongerOne - thisRidiculousLongOne + theFinalOne;
```

__Method chain case__

When multiple methods are chained in the same line - for example when using Builders - every call to a method should go in its own line, breaking the line before the `.`

```java
Picasso.with(context).load("http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg").into(imageView);
```

```java
Picasso.with(context)
        .load("http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg")
        .into(imageView);
```

__Long parameters case__

When a method has many parameters or its parameters are very long, we should break the line after every comma `,`

```java
loadPicture(context, "http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg", mImageViewProfilePicture, clickListener, "Title of the picture");
```

```java
loadPicture(context,
        "http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg",
        mImageViewProfilePicture,
        clickListener,
        "Title of the picture");
```

### 1.19 RxJava chains styling

Rx chains of operators require line-wrapping. Every operator must go in a new line and the line should be broken before the `.`

```java
public Observable<Location> syncLocations() {
    return mDatabaseHelper.getAllLocations()
            .concatMap(new Func1<Location, Observable<? extends Location>>() {
                @Override
                 public Observable<? extends Location> call(Location location) {
                     return mRetrofitService.getLocation(location.id);
                 }
            })
            .retry(new Func2<Integer, Throwable, Boolean>() {
                 @Override
                 public Boolean call(Integer numRetries, Throwable throwable) {
                     return throwable instanceof RetrofitError;
                 }
            });
}
```


## 2. Resources guidelines

### 2.3.1 Use self closing tags

When an XML element doesn't have any contents, you __must__ use self closing tags.

This is good:

```xml
<TextView
	android:id="@+id/profileTextView"
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

This is __bad__ :

```xml
<!-- Don\'t do this! -->
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/profileTextView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" >
</TextView>
```


### 2.3.2 Resources naming

Resource file names are written in __lowercase_underscore__, Style Names are __UpperCamelCase__ Everything else is __lowerCamelCase__.

#### 2.3.2.1 ID naming

IDs should be postfixed with the name of the element in camel case. For example:


| Element            | Prefix            |
| -----------------  | ----------------- |
| `TextView`           | `SomethingTextView`             |
| `ImageView`          | `SomethingImageView`            |
| `Button`             | `SomethingButton`           |
| `Menu`               | `SomethingMenu`             |

Image view example:

```xml
<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/profileImageView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Menu example:

```xml
<menu>
	<item
        android:id="@+id/doneMenu"
        android:title="Done" />
</menu>
```
